## Use

`kure config argon2 test [-i iterations] [-m memory] [-t threads]`

## Description

Test how is argon2 going to perform with the parameters passed.

The Argon2id variant with 1 iteration and maximum available memory is recommended as a default setting for all environments. This setting is secure against side-channel attacks and maximizes adversarial costs on dedicated bruteforce hardware.

> If one of the devices that will handle the database has lower than 1GB of memory, we recommend setting the memory according to that device's RAM availability.

- Memory: amount of memory allowed for argon2 to use, the more memory the better. The value is represented in kibibytes, 1 kibibyte = 1024 bytes. Default is 1048576 kibibytes (1 GiB).

- Iterations: number of passes over the memory. The running time depends linearly on this parameter. Default is 1.

- Threads: number of threads number in parallel. Default is the maximum number of logical CPUs usable.

### Examples

Test using 700MiB of memory, 2 iterations and 4 threads:
```
kure config argon2 test -m 716800 -i 2 -t 4
```
